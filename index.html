        <h2>about/</h2>
        <p>90mil Radio is an independent platform for artists, makers, authors and creatives exploring
            unconventional modes of expression, discourse and interdisciplinary practice. Our project amplifies
            femme and queer voices, as well storytellers, researchers, and activists focused on decolonisation and
            exploration of perspectives currently under-represented in the mainstream cultural landscape.</p>

        <p>We aim to provide a network node for experimental and emergent forms of sound, linguistic and time based
            media arts uninhibited by the status-quo that exists as a result of entrenched capitalist regulation in
            established broadcast ecosystems, while seeking to encourage emerging artists and people who are curious
            about broadcast media. Our team is passionate about facilitating an inviting space for newcomers to
            broadcasting; we offer opportunities for orientation, guidance, training and support throughout the
            process of co-creating our programme.</p>

        <p>We hope to nurture a sense of community by offering both real and decentralised space for
            experimentation, exchange, connection, solidarity and freedom of expression to our contributors and
            wider audience, while empowering new and experienced radio practitioners to explore forms of
            cross-pollination both within and beyond the arts.</p>
